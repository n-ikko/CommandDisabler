# CommandDisabler
A simple SpigotMC 1.20 plugin to disable certain commands.

## Usage
- 1. Install the plugin onto you're server
- 2. Reload or restart the server to generate the plugin config.
- 3. Modify the config as you would like, and restart/reload the server again.
- 4. Done! Now the plugin should work.

## Permissions
- "commanddisabler.bypass": Any player that has this permission does not get affected by the plugin. Default: OP

## Commands
- None at the moment. Planning on adding a config reload command, and a command to add and remove blocked commands.
